A visually captivating audio visualizer that transforms music into a dynamic network of glowing nodes and connections, reacting to the intensity, bass frequencies, and timbral characteristics of the sound.

Demo

(Optional: Include a link to a short video or GIF demo here. This is highly recommended!)

(Replace link_to_your_video_thumbnail.png with a placeholder image and link_to_your_video with the actual URL of your demo video (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo). You can also directly embed a GIF if it's not too large.)

You can also include a few static screenshots here:

Features

Dynamic Node Network: Visualizes audio as a network of interconnected nodes ("neurons").

Real-time Audio Analysis: Reacts to the intensity (loudness), bass frequencies, and spectral centroid (timbral brightness) of the audio.

Aesthetic Visuals:

Glowing node cores and auras with dynamically changing colors and sizes.

Connections that pulse and shift color based on node activity and audio characteristics.

Subtle background starfield for added depth.

Optional faint 3D grid.

Interactive Camera: Control the view with mouse drag (rotate) and scroll (zoom).

Simple GUI for Audio Selection: Uses tkinter to allow easy selection of audio files.

Node Activation Levels: Displays a numerical value representing the current activity of each node.

Prerequisites

Before running the visualizer, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

Pyglet: For the 3D graphics and windowing.

Librosa: For audio analysis (loading, RMS, spectral centroid).

NumPy: For numerical computations.

SciPy: Required by Librosa.

Pillow (PIL): Often a dependency for Pyglet's text rendering.

Tkinter: Usually comes bundled with Python for the file selection dialog.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyglet librosa numpy scipy Pillow
```

It is highly recommended to create and activate a virtual environment before installing the dependencies to keep your project isolated.

Installation and Usage

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd [repository_directory]
```

(Replace repository_url with the actual URL of your GitHub repository and repository_directory with the name of the cloned folder.)

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

```bash

For macOS and Linux

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

For Windows (PowerShell)

python -m venv .venv
..venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

For Windows (Command Prompt)

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install Dependencies:

If you haven't already, install the required libraries within your activated virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(It's good practice to create a requirements.txt file listing your dependencies. You can generate one using pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the libraries.)

Run the Visualizer:

Navigate to the directory containing your Python script (e.g., audio_visualizer_gui.py) and run it:

```bash
python audio_visualizer_gui.py
```

A file dialog will open, allowing you to select an audio file (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .ogg, .flac). Once you select a file, the visualizer window will appear.

Controls

Mouse Left-Click Drag: Rotate the camera around the 3D scene.

Mouse Scroll Wheel: Zoom in and out.

Customization

You can customize various aspects of the visualizer by modifying the configuration variables at the beginning of the Python script:

WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT: Adjust the size of the visualizer window.

NUM_NODES: Control the number of nodes in the network.

NODE_DISTRIBUTION_RADIUS: Determine how spread out the nodes are initially.

NODE_*_BASE_SIZE, NODE_SIZE_MULTIPLIER: Affect the base size and responsiveness of the nodes.

CONNECTION_THRESHOLD_DISTANCE: Set the maximum distance for nodes to form a connection.

FPS: Control the frames per second of the visualization.

Color mappings and other visual parameters within the Node and VisualizerWindow classes.

Experiment with these values to achieve different visual effects!
